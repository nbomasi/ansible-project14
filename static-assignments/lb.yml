  roles:
    - { role: nginx, when: enable_nginx_lb and load_balancer_is_required }
    - { role: apache, when: enable_apache_lb and load_balancer_is_required }

#NOTE: ON nginx role, tasks/main.yml, default/main.yml, template/nginx.conf.j2 were edited by me for load balancing configuration, not just to install nginx
# For apache, default/main.yml, template/vhosts.conf.j2 were edited for same purpose as nginx
